Snap has just released the next generation of Spectacles, its wearable camera, with new features for taking photos and water resistance. The sunglasses, which have the same striking form as the first-generation model, have been slimmed down and now come in three jewel tones: black, red, and blue.

The Spectacles 2.0 have a slimmer design, which allows them to fit easily in your pockets or even dangle from your t-shirt. Snap has also improved the transfer speeds between the glasses and the phone. Another great feature on the new glasses is that they are now water resistant!

Theyâ€™re available to order at Spectacles.com for $150.

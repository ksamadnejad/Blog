Judges of the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year have disqualified a winning contestant after the anteater in his prize-winning photograph was judged “highly likely” to be a taxidermy specimen. Called “The Night Raider,” the image was taken by photographer Marcio Cabral and depicts an anteater underneath starry skies next to a termite mound dotted with glowing bioluminescence.

The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition is run by the Natural History Museum in London, and Cabral’s photo won the category for Animals in their Environment in 2017. The NHM started an investigation into the photo after it was contacted in March by anonymous sources who questioned the authenticity of the image. The NHM said it was given evidence including high resolution photos of a taxidermy anteater at Portão do Bandeira gate, one of the entrances of Emas National Park in Brazil where the winning photo was taken.

In a statement, the NHM said, “After a thorough investigation, the museum concluded that the available evidence points to this allegation being true. As a result, the museum believes that the image breaches the competition rules, which state that ‘entries must not deceive the viewer or attempt to misrepresent the reality of nature."

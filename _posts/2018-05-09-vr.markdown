Google has launched a new tool for teachers and their students called Tour Creator, which allows anyone to create their own VR tour using imagery from Googleâ€™s Street View or their own 360-degree photos.

The goal with Expeditions is to let people virtually travel the world to see far off places they may never have the chance to visit in person.

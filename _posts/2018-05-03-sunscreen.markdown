Hawaii lawmakers have approved a ban on types of sunscreen that are believed to be the result of the dying coral reefs. The two chemicals that are harmful and are on the ingredients list for sunscreen are oxybenzone and octinoxate. 

In lab experiments, oxybenzone was found to deform coral larvae by trapping them within their own skeleton and cause coral bleaching in established corals.

The ban is set to start in 2021. This gives manufacturers of these products a few years to change their formulas to be within standards for tourists and residents in Hawaii.

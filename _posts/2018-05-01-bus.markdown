 A Pennsylvania company, Momentum Dynamics, has announced the commissioning of a 200-kilowatt wireless charging system for a bus fleet. 
 
 The charger adds enough energy to the bus battery during a five minute stop to allow it to complete another route cycle. The charging system is embedded into the pavement at a Link Transit transfer station stop. Each time the BYD bus parks over the charger, its battery is automatically recharged.
